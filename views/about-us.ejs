        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p>
          Applinic is a global platform for the delivery of telehealthand management of patients’ health information. It is a web and mobile application with multi-disciplinary interfaces and unique tools and services for different health providers including physicians, clinics, hospitals, diagnostic centers and pharmacies. It also delivers a user-friendly interface to the patient for finding providers, accessing care and archiving medical records. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The telehealth services available on the platform include tele-consultation, tele-monitoring, telediagnosis and telepharmacy including electronic prescription. 
        </p>

        <h6 class="h6 text-muted">Teleconsultation</h6>

        <p>
          Patients can find physicians on the platform by specialty, by complaints or by name and initiate communication with them via instant messaging chat. When physicians accept consultation requests from patients, the system opens other communication lines such as audio and video consultation. Applinic audio and video consultations have inbuilt clerking page which enables physicians write during the consultation. Third parties can also be invited for a video conference.
        </p>

        <h6 class="h6 text-muted">Telemonitoring</h6>

        <p>
          Patients who have measuring devices for blood pressure, sugar and temperature can record their daily or regular measurements in their mobile apps for their physicians to review at any time during clinics and off consultation periods. The date filters and  graphical display of the measured readings enable the reviewer appreciate the patterns at a glance and easily make decisions that will save lives or prevent complications. Applinic Tele-monitoring service powers an algorithm based notification which senses abnormal readings based on preset WHO reference ranges and notifies the physician for appropriate response. 
        </p>

         <h6 class="h6 text-muted">Telediagnosis</h6>

         <p>
           Physicians can use the platform to request diagnostic laboratory, radiology and cardiac investigations for their patients. The diagnostic centers can also send the results and reports to the referring physician and patients through the platform. Digital X-ray images, CT scan and MRI can be viewed by both physician and patient using the inbuilt web and mobile DICOM Viewer.   
         </p>

         <h6 class="h6 text-muted">Telepharmacy</h6>
         <p>
           Physicians can use Applinic to write electronic prescriptions for their patients who either pick up the drugs at designated pharmacies or enjoy delivery where the service is available. E-prescriptions reduce errors of drug dispensing from doctors’ bad hand writing, keep records of patients drug history and facilitates search of drugs in cities.  
         </p>
