<h4>Introducton</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Applinic is an online platform where patients meet doctors, interact and consult with them, search for and receive services of diagnostic centers and buy drugs from pharmacies, all at discounted prices. 
Applinic also ensures that records of these treatments are kept for the patient in a secure cloud for future access. Built on cutting edge technology, the functionalities of Applinic are based on real time communication for a more effective approach to online qualitative healthcare.<br>
Aside medical emergencies, most of the patient’s health care needsand the information resources and functionalities required by the Health Care Providers (HCPs) to deliver efficient health care in a digital age are provided and maintained by our high back end engine and proficient support team. 

<div id="patients"></div>
<br><br>

<h4>Patients</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Patients create Applinic accounts for free. This entitles them to an account dashboard for management of their activities. The patient’s dashboard has the utilities to access all medical needs. For example, from the dashboard, the patient can find a doctor of any specialty, within any city and request for an appointment with him or her for online or onsite consultation. <br> 

To access this service, go to the “Searches” button on the top right and select –“find a doctor”, enter the specialty, if you know and the preferred city you want the doctor and click search. Other filters include the doctor’s name and Platform ID. From the search result you can book (send consultation request to) a doctor of interest. The doctor will be notified of this request real time if he is online, otherwise an SMS notification will be sent to him. <br>

The “Need a Doctor” utility is used to submit health complaints to doctors. Images and videos of the complaint may also be uploaded. Doctors specialized in the condition will respond immediately. From there, a relationship can be established, chats can commence and appointments made for consultation either online by video or onsite by in-person meeting. <br> 
 
Patients can also receive drug prescriptions from doctors through the dashboard, search for pharmacies which have the drugs on the platform and forward the prescription to thestore from there. Patients can also receive investigation requests from their doctors through Applinic, search for diagnostic centers providing the services and send the request forms to them.Theresults of the investigations will also be sent to their dashboard and to the referring physician.<br>  

Patients and doctors can choose to use our courier services. This utility allows them place orders for the home/office/hotel/anywhere delivery of the drugs purchased online on Applinic. Learn more about our delivery services.<br>
 
If a customer needs help, for example with finding the right center or specialist or general help on how to use certain utilities, please click the “Need Help?“ button and complete the form. A member of the Applinic team will contact you within 24 hours for support. 

<div id="communication"></div>
<br><br>

<h4>Communications on Applinic</h4>
<div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Patients communicate with doctors basically through the live text chat. They can also send request for audio or video web calls or seek appointment for in-person meeting. 

If any of the above types of request is granted, the patient will be notified in real time. The doctor can also initiate a request for in-person appointment with patient or for audio or video call. In this case,the patient will be notified. Either case, if any of the parties is offline, a notification SMS will be sent to his registered phone.<br>



When the patient or doctor sends an audio or video call request, the other will be prompted to accept or decline. If the request is accepted the system will automatically redirect both to the multimedia communication page.<br> 

All accounts are based on phone numbers. If a customer loses or changeshis phone number, it is pertinent tonotify Applinic or update his profile with the new phone number respectively. This way he is not shut out from privileges and services that require his phone. Phone numbers are the primary means of identification, authentication and verification on the platform. 


<div id="doctors"></div>

<br><br>
<h4 >Doctors</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Doctors can sign up to create accounts for free. The acclaimed qualifications of registered doctors will be verified through the appropriate National/International professional bodies before they can practice on Applinic. Successfully verified physicians will be notified and their dashboards activated to manage their patients, their e-wallet and their practice.<br>

Patients can send consultation requeststo doctors which they (the doctors) can accept or decline. If accepted, patient will be notified in real time. The acceptance will include the doctor’s consultation fee which will be presented to the patient. If patient accepts this fee, the doctor will be notified in real time and the patient’s account will be debited of this amount and his name added to the doctor’s list of patients. From there the management can commence.
 
When a doctor writes a prescription for a patient, there are two options for servicing it:<br>
 
<b>Send to a preferred pharmacy:</b><br>
In this case, the doctor will search and find a pharmacy to send the prescription to. Once sent, the center will receive the prescription in real time. A Reference Number will be issued which identifies the prescription. The patient should always have this number for it will be used to find the prescription  whenthe patient visitsthe pharmaceutical center the prescription was sent to.<br> 

<b>Send to Patient: </b><br>
Whenthe doctor does not have particular interest in the pharmacy for servicing the prescription, he can send the prescription to the patient who may forward it to his pharmaceutical center of choice.<br>
 
Doctors can refer patients for laboratory and or radiological investigations. This will notify the center in real time about the request. Reference number will be issued for the identification of the test when the patient arrives at the center. 
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and Explanatory Palettes in the doctors’ dashboard provides all the explanation and information the doctor needs to use the platform for service practice and business satisfactorily.

<div id="session"></div>
<br><br>

<h4>Sessions</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Sessions (treatment sessions) refer to periods of doctor-patient interactions for the management of specific conditions. Each session contains chats, diagnostic investigation results, prescriptions and doctors notes. It is the equivalent of patients’ case note in the hospital.<br>

Sessions can be created by the doctor or initiated when the application matches a patient with one.

Sessions are usually identified by the date the conversation was initiated. Every session is auto-saved in the patients account for future reference. Only the consulting physician and patient can see the sessions they had. Doctors managing the same patient will see their sessions with him but not that with other doctors except the patient grants them access through an OTP. <br>

<b>Creation of Sessions</b><br>
During a physical or online consultation, the doctor cancreate a session by clicking the session button. Most tools needed for the consultation are available on the doctor’s dashboard for his use. He can take notes, book appointments, refer patients for laboratory or radiological investigations and write prescriptions.<br> 

Note that sessions are not created when the patient initially chats with doctor in a quest for consultation. Chat is the primary line of communication.Sessions arecreated by the doctor when he accepts a patient’s request for consultation.
A doctor can create a new patient for consultation from his dashboards if the patient was not previously registered.This registration would be temporal until the patient updates his profile by providing other required mandatory profile information. In the interim, the doctor will be able to use all the available tools for his consultation.


<div id="pharma"></div>
<br><br>

<h4>Pharmaceutical Centers</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Interested certified pharmacies can partner with Applinic by creating free accounts on the platform to service patients and sell pharmaceutical products. This can happen only after their verification. Following registration, the center will receive a call or notification on the verification date. 
Successfully verified centers will be activated on the platform. This will create pharmacy dashboard with an inventory for products population and electronic wallet for receiving payments.  
Partnering pharmaceutical centers operate by servicing electronic prescriptions and product purchase requests from doctors, patients and other health providers. Each e-prescription or request has a unique Reference ID the pharmacy will use to identify it on the platform. <br>
Patients pay through their e-wallet and the pharmacy account is credited instantly before the drug is dispensed. 
Pharmacies who are out of stock of requested drugs may forward the prescription to other centers.<br>

Customers who don’t have Applinic accounts but desire to register one or to use the application to save their prescriptions can be assisted by the partnering pharmacies. Pharmacies can create accounts for new patients and customers before selling products to them.
They can also search for registered patients using their phone or Registration number before serving them. 
 
    
<div id="diagnostic"></div>  
<br><br>

<h4>Diagnostic Centers</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
Registered and verified radiology and laboratory centers can receive investigation requestsfrom doctors, other health providers and patients through the platform. The center willsee the requests in their notification box if it was sent specifically to them or will have to search for them with the patient’s phone or reference number if it was non-specifically sent.<br>

Diagnostic centers can also use the patients’ Phone or Registration numbers to search their accounts to view and act on pending requests or to enter the results of the completed investigations.<br>

When patients pay for investigations through their e-wallets, the diagnostic centers will be credited instantly. This is the recommended payment option otherwise the records cannot be archived.<br>

Diagnostic centers will conduct the investigations they render and forward those they don’t provide to other centers. Diagnostic results can be filled and generated through the platform’s result template. This result can be printed or accessed online from anywhere by authorized personnel who have Applinic accounts.<br>

Customers who don’t have Applinic accounts but desire to register one for archiving their health records for easy future access can be assisted in this registration by the diagnostic centers if the payment for the investigation is made through the application. Centers can create Applinic accounts for new patients before serving them. The account is free.


<div id="ewallet"></div>
<br><br>

<h4>Payment and E-Wallet (MediPay)</h4><div class="separator01 separator-primary"></div>
<b>Fund wallet</b><br>
Applinic is secure, and all health and financial information of patients areencrypted end-to-end. It has an e-wallet payment system for all online paymets through the platform. This is the MediPay. Patients can use the MediPay tomake payments directly to health service providers - doctors, special centers, pharmacies and diagnostic centers through their electronic wallets. The e-wallets are funded on the platform using debit or credit cards or directly from the user’s bank account through a payment gateway. This direct bank account debit is authenticated through a Verification Code (VC) or One Time Pass word (OTP) sent to the customer’s phone.<br>

Each payment made for the purpose of funding the wallet generates a PIN which the user keys in to credit his e-wallet. When patients fund their wallets, the money remains secure in their accounts. From here, they can fund all healthcare bills on Applinic with no transaction charges.
Paying for health services through the Applinice-wallet attracts discounts. Doctors’ consultation fees, drug charges, diagnostic services and treatment costs are all discounted between 5-50% when payments for them are made through the e-wallet. More so, the records of medical treatments, drug prescriptions and diagnostic results are kept in patients’ accounts only when payments for them are made through the wallet. So payment through the e-wallet is a double win for the patient; and technically that is the only way the application can know the patient received the service. Payments made with cash to the service provider do not tunnel through the platform workflow so no records of the associated health information will be kept. This is not advisable for those who desire to keep a electronic record of their health history and everybody should. 
Patients who want to enjoy the discount associated with the e-payment but deliberately don’t want to keep the record of that health service can select the No Health Record (NHR) option in the payment page. This will disable the archival of the particular record, and still grant the discount.<br> 

<b>Fund transfer </b><br>
Funds can be transferred between users on Applinic provided the transfer amount is available in the creditor’s wallet. Peer to peer funds transfer is useful in situations where registered users need to access medical services but do not have the requisite fundin their wallet to pay for them but they have a family or friend who owns an account and is willing to come to their aid. For example, a father can come to the aid of a daughter in college who is sick and has just received a doctor’s prescription but has not enough money to pay. A son abroad can pay for the mother’s prescription in Africa after she has been reviewed by an Applinic doctor who issued her a prescription. 
Like other financial transactions on Applinic, this service requires authentication by a One Time Password sent to the creditor’s phone.<br>  

<b>Cash Out</b><br> 
The health service providers cash out earned monies from their wallets through their registered bank accounts. There are no cash out limits. 
This utility is available to only health service providers - doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and diagnostic centers. These users can request to withdraw from the e-wallet any amount they have earned. This request is processed within 24 hours and credited to the provided bank account after verification. A Verification Code (VC) or One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to the HSPs registered phone to confirm he initiated the transaction.
