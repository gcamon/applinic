				<h6>Will updating my skills and procedures help ?</h6>
Patients and those who represent them will often search the platform for physicians who possess certain skills, render specific services, or perform certain procedures. You need to update your skills, services and procedures so that your name will appear when such services are searched for in your city or country. This is one of the fastest ways to grow your practice. Please review the information palette on your dashboard titled Skills and Procedures to learn how to do this.

<h6>Can I bring my pre-existing patients to manage on Applinic ?</h6>
All existing patients you currently manage as well as those who may still contact you in the future can be directed or invited to meet you at Applinic. They can create their free accounts or you may help them create one. There are three advantages of directing your patients to Applinic. First is the leverage it grants you to manage them on-the-go; second is the ease of accessing their medical records and results of diagnostic investigations right from your device and the third is the opportunity of having them pay for consultation and treatment through their wallets and you get immediate value in your account.      



<h6>What is the Patients Waiting Room (PWR) ?</h6>
The PWR is the major source of new patients for doctors. It is a pool of all complaints from our global community of patients. The complaints are anonymous. The PWR button is located on the top of the doctors’ dashboard. Click it to navigate to the room. Doctors visit the room to review and respond to the cases posted by patients which pertain to their specialty. Your initial response should include your opinion on the case and a possible plan of how you intend to manage the condition. The system expects you to state your consultation fee at this time but this is not mandatory. If you offer your advice with consultation fees, the patient may approve the offer and his or her account will be debited while yours will be credited or he may decline it. If accepted, a consultation session will immediately open to enable communication between both of you by chat, video, or in-person appointment at your chosen clinic.   

<h6>Why should I check the PWR always ?</h6>
Aside your known patients who consult you directly and others who specifically searched for you, you will not see all other complaints from the patients in the community or obtain new patients to grow your practice except you visit the Patients Waiting Room. It is here that doctors review all complaints from patients to identify those which concern their specialty for response. 
	
<h6>Can other health providers or Applinic team refer patients to me ?</h6>
Your colleagues, pharmacies and diagnostic centers can refer patients to you if they encounter patients with conditions which pertain to your specialty. Those who know you may do so easily but others may have to find you on the platform before they can refer a patient to you. This is possible if you have updated the Skills and Procedures section of your profile.  The Applinic team may also refer patients to your specialty is applicable.

<h6>How does updating my profile increase patronage ?</h6>
If it is updated, your profile will boost the confidence of patients who don’t know you. Your picture, qualifications, awards, skills and procedures will all aggregate to attract more cases, referrals, consultations and of course opportunities to save lives, alleviate sufferings and mitigate disorders if you keep the world updated on who you are and what you  do. Of course this should eventually translate to more revenues if you don’t mind.

			   <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'manage'">
				<h6>Where do I see all my patients ?</h6>
All users whom you have ever treated or who have accepted your treatment offer become your patients. Once a relationship has been established between you and the patient, he or she will be added to your list of patients. This list is accessible from the left hand menu of your dashboard. To access all your patients on a laptop or desktop, click on “My Patients” tab on the left menu and the drop down will list all your patients, with last one first. To access it on mobile, click in the menu sign (3 horizontal lines on top, also called “hamburger sign”) and the menu will open on the left of your screen. After ‘My Patients’ tab has dropped your list of patients, you may scroll down or type the patient’s name in the filter bar to find him if the list is a long one.Click on the patient’s name to load his or her details including your last chat with him and case note. You can toggle between the chat and the consultation sessions. You may also review entries, prescriptions and diagnostic results as desired or continue consultation by chat, video or appointment at your clinic.

<h6>How do I keep records of patients’ clerking ?</h6>
There are various sources of patients on Applinic. Irrespective of how you received the patient, once he or she has accepted your medical opinion and consultation offer, a chat and management session will immediately be enabled between both of you. This chat and the management session folders will remain visible to you except the patient denies you access or unsubscribes for the service. You keep records of your clerking by opening treatment sessions and entering the notes there. There are also buttons for continuation sheets during follow up visits, and others for physical examinations, diagnostic requests, prescriptions and medical reports.  

<h6>How do I manage the clerkship ?</h6>
As soon as the relationship is established, the patient’s e-folder will become available to you to type or dictate (when implemented) your clerkship according to the standard format: history, general and systemic examination, summary, diagnosis, investigations and treatment. These entries will remain in the patient’s folders and accessible to you. You can use the Chat Toggle button to switch from Chat to Case Note and back. 

<h6>How do I request or view investigations ?</h6>
Laboratory and Radiological investigations requests can be filled in the dashboard and the request sent using the e-request forms in the patient’s folder. These diagnostic request forms are available in the treatment sessions. After filling the request, the system provides a quick search for the diagnostic centers in your selected city which provide the services for you to choose from. When the list displays, you may choose to send it to your preferred center or let the patient who also receives a copy of the request forward it to his or her center of choice. He or she will be required to go to the laboratory to perform the investigation or give them the sample. Occasionally, some laboratories provide home service. This option may also be selected. All results of diagnostic investigations will be available for your review on the patient’s folder when you log into your dashboard. The envelope notification icon on your dashboard will indicate when the result is received.   

<h6>How do I send prescriptions ? </h6>
Prescriptions can be written according to the standard format using the e-prescription form in the patient’s folder. After writing a prescription, you can search for the pharmacies which have the drugs in your selected city. When the list displays, you may choose to send it to a preferred pharmacy which has them or allow the patient because he also receives a copy of the prescription to forward it to his or her pharmacy of choice. Prescriptions can be paid for at the pharmacy through the MediPay e-wallet and drugs picked up. Alternatively, a request may be made for dispatch service to deliver them if this service is available in the city. 
	
<h6>How do I improve my rating and search ranking ?</h6>
One of the objectives of Applinic is to elevate the ethical standards of practice among health providers through accountability and feedback from patients. Rating of providers is one way patients can contribute to this standardization. The way providers relate with patients is very important in health care delivery. The more refined this relationship is the better the patients’ response to treatment and recovery will be. Applinic has defined five virtue pairs and practice attributes against which patients will rate providers after treatment sessions. 

<h6>What are the five parameters for rating providers ?</h6>

The five criteria for patients to use to rate providers are:<br>
i.	Excellence/Aptness (Doctors is mostly correct in his opinions, judgments and decisions and the outcome of his treatment  is usually successful and accurate)<br>
ii.	Sensitivity/Empathy (Doctor is compassionate to patient in his suffering, shows kindness and care, and treats him like his own)<br>
iii.	Informative/Enlightening (Doctor generously enlightens patients, freely  answers his questions and explains about his conditions and other associated matters to him without hesitation)<br>
iv.	Sociability/Friendliness (Doctor treats patient like a friend, is nice and warm, welcoming and hospitable)<br>
v.	Promptness/Punctuality (Doctor responds to chats or other requests  promptly, is punctual for appointments and treats patients like a king)

<h6>How do I ensure I don’t lose patients ?</h6>
By observing the standard of medical ethics and relationship listed above; by observing the principles of patients’ confidentiality and privacy of health information; by offering your patients the best and referring them to colleagues who specialize in the conditions you observe in them; by promptly responding to their messages and keeping your bills moderate, you will not lose patients on Applinic, rather you will grow your practice quicker than you would without it.

<h6>How can publications and videos help my practice ?</h6>
Publications and videos will create awareness about your skills and procedures and inform your colleagues and searching patients about the local availability of such services. It will also help build confidence in patients intending to use those skills of their safety and allay their anxieties and fears.

				<h6>What is the basic mode of communication ?</h6>
Four modes of communication are available on Applinic. Instant messaging chats, audio calls, video calls and in-person meetings. For the last, the appointment scheduler of the platform can be used to schedule appointments with patients. 

<h6>Why is it advisable to be online always ?</h6>
It is advisable to be online always so you don’t miss a patient or an opportunity to be of service. You can be logged in always with your laptop or mobile device or can have a trusted junior colleague, matron or nurse do that for you. They do not have to respond to your patients’ enquiries if you don’t want them to. They basically will notify you of requests, notifications and chats from patients so you can remember to respond to them. Sometimes they may use your known clinic schedule to give appointments on your behalf. You will see the appointments scheduled for your patients when you log in. You can review the patients’ medical history before the appointment if the patient gives you his Medical Record Access (MRA) Key. 

<h6>How can I review a patient’s past medical records ?</h6>
You can view the past medical records of a patient only if you are currently managing or have managed him in the past. If you want to view the medical records of a new patient, then he or she must give you his or her Medical Records Access (MRA) Key. This is a token the system will require of you when you request for the medical history of the patient you didn’t generate. Only the patient can give you this token. He will copy it from his dashboard and pass it on to you during a chat. Copy it and paste in the appropriate field.

				 <h6>What are the available modes of communication ?</h6>
There are four modes for communication between you and your Applinic patients: instant messaging chat, audio and video calls and the regular in-person meeting scheduled with the appointment module. 

<h6>How does the chat, audio and video call work ?</h6>
These communication modules become activated between you and each patient for the first time after the patient has accepted your treatment offer. After a patient has shared his or her complaints with you directly or through the PWR, you will respond with a management plan and a consultation fee which the patient may or may not accept. If the patient accepts it, his account will be debited and yours credited and then all the above communication lines will open up between both of you. This patient will then be listed in your list of patients easily accessible from your dashboard. Subsequently he or she may request for chats, audio and video appointments with you or for in-person meeting.  

<h6>How do I participate in a video conference ?</h6>
After two parties have scheduled a video call appointment, other participants may also be invited to join them. All participants must have Applinic accounts and must be online at the time. If they are not, an SMS will be sent to their phones to invite them to the conference. 

<h6>What notifications should I expect ?</h6>

The first is an envelope sign for notification on patients’ consultation requests and offer acceptances while the second is a chat sign for notification on pending chats.

If they are not available, you can search for them in other pharmacies and in other cities until you find them.

Patients are either billed from the consultation request page (Consultation fee) or from the patients’ e-folder (treatment/procedure fee). Doctors generate their bills and present to the patient for review. If they accept it, the system will debit their account and credit you. If not, the transaction will not happen. If the patient doesn’t have enough money in his account, the system will prompt him or her to fund the account.

<h6>What if the transaction fails ?</h6>
If due to network failure or other reason, the transaction fails to complete, the process may be repeated up to three times. If the failure persists, the health provider can collect cash from the patient and call our toll free Customer Service line to report the failed transaction for manual entry into the system or fill the failed transaction form to report it. This will enable us update the transaction and enter the prescription or diagnostic results into the patient’s account. The equivalent discount will then be debited the provider and credited the patient.
