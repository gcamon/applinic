				<h6>Will updating my skills and procedures help ?</h6>
Patients and those who represent them will often search the platform for physicians who possess certain skills, render specific services, or perform certain procedures. You need to update your skills, services and procedures so that your name will appear when such services are searched for in your city or country. This is one of the fastest ways to grow your practice. Please review the information palette on your dashboard titled Skills and Procedures to learn how to do this.
<br><br>
<h6>Can I bring my pre-existing patients to manage on Applinic ?</h6>
All existing patients you currently manage as well as those who may still contact you in the future can be directed or invited to meet you at Applinic. They can create their free accounts or you may help them create one. There are three advantages of directing your patients to Applinic. First is the leverage it grants you to manage them on-the-go; second is the ease of accessing their medical records and results of diagnostic investigations right from your device and the third is the opportunity of having them pay for consultation and treatment through their wallets and you get immediate value in your account.      

<br/><br/>

<h6>What is the Patients Waiting Room (PWR) ?</h6>
The PWR is the major source of new patients for doctors. It is a pool of all complaints from our global community of patients. The complaints are anonymous. The PWR button is located on the top of the doctors’ dashboard. Click it to navigate to the room. Doctors visit the room to review and respond to the cases posted by patients which pertain to their specialty. Your initial response should include your opinion on the case and a possible plan of how you intend to manage the condition. The system expects you to state your consultation fee at this time but this is not mandatory. If you offer your advice with consultation fees, the patient may approve the offer and his or her account will be debited while yours will be credited or he may decline it. If accepted, a consultation session will immediately open to enable communication between both of you by chat, video, or in-person appointment at your chosen clinic.   
<br/><br/>
<h6>Why should I check the PWR always ?</h6>
Aside your known patients who consult you directly and others who specifically searched for you, you will not see all other complaints from the patients in the community or obtain new patients to grow your practice except you visit the Patients Waiting Room. It is here that doctors review all complaints from patients to identify those which concern their specialty for response. 
	<br/><br/>
<h6>Can other health providers or Applinic team refer patients to me ?</h6>
Your colleagues, pharmacies and diagnostic centers can refer patients to you if they encounter patients with conditions which pertain to your specialty. Those who know you may do so easily but others may have to find you on the platform before they can refer a patient to you. This is possible if you have updated the Skills and Procedures section of your profile.  The Applinic team may also refer patients to your specialty is applicable.
<br/><br/>
<h6>How does updating my profile increase patronage ?</h6>
If it is updated, your profile will boost the confidence of patients who don’t know you. Your picture, qualifications, awards, skills and procedures will all aggregate to attract more cases, referrals, consultations and of course opportunities to save lives, alleviate sufferings and mitigate disorders if you keep the world updated on who you are and what you  do. Of course this should eventually translate to more revenues if you don’t mind.

			  </div>


			   <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'manage'">
				<h6>Where do I see all my patients ?</h6>
All users whom you have ever treated or who have accepted your treatment offer become your patients. Once a relationship has been established between you and the patient, he or she will be added to your list of patients. This list is accessible from the left hand menu of your dashboard. To access all your patients on a laptop or desktop, click on “My Patients” tab on the left menu and the drop down will list all your patients, with last one first. To access it on mobile, click in the menu sign (3 horizontal lines on top, also called “hamburger sign”) and the menu will open on the left of your screen. After ‘My Patients’ tab has dropped your list of patients, you may scroll down or type the patient’s name in the filter bar to find him if the list is a long one.Click on the patient’s name to load his or her details including your last chat with him and case note. You can toggle between the chat and the consultation sessions. You may also review entries, prescriptions and diagnostic results as desired or continue consultation by chat, video or appointment at your clinic.
<br/><br/>
<h6>How do I keep records of patients’ clerking ?</h6>
There are various sources of patients on Applinic. Irrespective of how you received the patient, once he or she has accepted your medical opinion and consultation offer, a chat and management session will immediately be enabled between both of you. This chat and the management session folders will remain visible to you except the patient denies you access or unsubscribes for the service. You keep records of your clerking by opening treatment sessions and entering the notes there. There are also buttons for continuation sheets during follow up visits, and others for physical examinations, diagnostic requests, prescriptions and medical reports.  
<br/><br/>
<h6>How do I manage the clerkship ?</h6>
As soon as the relationship is established, the patient’s e-folder will become available to you to type or dictate (when implemented) your clerkship according to the standard format: history, general and systemic examination, summary, diagnosis, investigations and treatment. These entries will remain in the patient’s folders and accessible to you. You can use the Chat Toggle button to switch from Chat to Case Note and back. 
<br/><br/>
<h6>How do I request or view investigations ?</h6>
Laboratory and Radiological investigations requests can be filled in the dashboard and the request sent using the e-request forms in the patient’s folder. These diagnostic request forms are available in the treatment sessions. After filling the request, the system provides a quick search for the diagnostic centers in your selected city which provide the services for you to choose from. When the list displays, you may choose to send it to your preferred center or let the patient who also receives a copy of the request forward it to his or her center of choice. He or she will be required to go to the laboratory to perform the investigation or give them the sample. Occasionally, some laboratories provide home service. This option may also be selected. All results of diagnostic investigations will be available for your review on the patient’s folder when you log into your dashboard. The envelope notification icon on your dashboard will indicate when the result is received.   
<br/><br/>
<h6>How do I send prescriptions ? </h6>
Prescriptions can be written according to the standard format using the e-prescription form in the patient’s folder. After writing a prescription, you can search for the pharmacies which have the drugs in your selected city. When the list displays, you may choose to send it to a preferred pharmacy which has them or allow the patient because he also receives a copy of the prescription to forward it to his or her pharmacy of choice. Prescriptions can be paid for at the pharmacy through the MediPay e-wallet and drugs picked up. Alternatively, a request may be made for dispatch service to deliver them if this service is available in the city. 
	<br/><br/>
<h6>How do I improve my rating and search ranking ?</h6>
One of the objectives of Applinic is to elevate the ethical standards of practice among health providers through accountability and feedback from patients. Rating of providers is one way patients can contribute to this standardization. The way providers relate with patients is very important in health care delivery. The more refined this relationship is the better the patients’ response to treatment and recovery will be. Applinic has defined five virtue pairs and practice attributes against which patients will rate providers after treatment sessions. 
<br/><br/>
<h6>What are the five parameters for rating providers ?</h6>

The five criteria for patients to use to rate providers are:<br>
i.	Excellence/Aptness (Doctors is mostly correct in his opinions, judgments and decisions and the outcome of his treatment  is usually successful and accurate)<br>
ii.	Sensitivity/Empathy (Doctor is compassionate to patient in his suffering, shows kindness and care, and treats him like his own)<br>
iii.	Informative/Enlightening (Doctor generously enlightens patients, freely  answers his questions and explains about his conditions and other associated matters to him without hesitation)<br>
iv.	Sociability/Friendliness (Doctor treats patient like a friend, is nice and warm, welcoming and hospitable)<br>
v.	Promptness/Punctuality (Doctor responds to chats or other requests  promptly, is punctual for appointments and treats patients like a king)<br><br>

<h6>How do I ensure I don’t lose patients ?</h6>
By observing the standard of medical ethics and relationship listed above; by observing the principles of patients’ confidentiality and privacy of health information; by offering your patients the best and referring them to colleagues who specialize in the conditions you observe in them; by promptly responding to their messages and keeping your bills moderate, you will not lose patients on Applinic, rather you will grow your practice quicker than you would without it.<br><br>

<h6>How can publications and videos help my practice ?</h6>
Publications and videos will create awareness about your skills and procedures and inform your colleagues and searching patients about the local availability of such services. It will also help build confidence in patients intending to use those skills of their safety and allay their anxieties and fears.

			   <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'consult'">
				<h6>What is the basic mode of communication ?</h6>
Four modes of communication are available on Applinic. Instant messaging chats, audio calls, video calls and in-person meetings. For the last, the appointment scheduler of the platform can be used to schedule appointments with patients. <br><br>

<h6>Why is it advisable to be online always ?</h6>
It is advisable to be online always so you don’t miss a patient or an opportunity to be of service. You can be logged in always with your laptop or mobile device or can have a trusted junior colleague, matron or nurse do that for you. They do not have to respond to your patients’ enquiries if you don’t want them to. They basically will notify you of requests, notifications and chats from patients so you can remember to respond to them. Sometimes they may use your known clinic schedule to give appointments on your behalf. You will see the appointments scheduled for your patients when you log in. You can review the patients’ medical history before the appointment if the patient gives you his Medical Record Access (MRA) Key. <br><br>

<h6>How can I review a patient’s past medical records ?</h6>
You can view the past medical records of a patient only if you are currently managing or have managed him in the past. If you want to view the medical records of a new patient, then he or she must give you his or her Medical Records Access (MRA) Key. This is a token the system will require of you when you request for the medical history of the patient you didn’t generate. Only the patient can give you this token. He will copy it from his dashboard and pass it on to you during a chat. Copy it and paste in the appropriate field.

			  </div>


			   <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'comm'">
				 <h6>What are the available modes of communication ?</h6>
There are four modes for communication between you and your Applinic patients: instant messaging chat, audio and video calls and the regular in-person meeting scheduled with the appointment module. <br><br>

<h6>How does the chat, audio and video call work ?</h6>
These communication modules become activated between you and each patient for the first time after the patient has accepted your treatment offer. After a patient has shared his or her complaints with you directly or through the PWR, you will respond with a management plan and a consultation fee which the patient may or may not accept. If the patient accepts it, his account will be debited and yours credited and then all the above communication lines will open up between both of you. This patient will then be listed in your list of patients easily accessible from your dashboard. Subsequently he or she may request for chats, audio and video appointments with you or for in-person meeting.  <br><br>

<h6>How do I participate in a video conference ?</h6>
After two parties have scheduled a video call appointment, other participants may also be invited to join them. All participants must have Applinic accounts and must be online at the time. If they are not, an SMS will be sent to their phones to invite them to the conference. <br><br>

<h6>What notifications should I expect ?</h6>
On top of the dashboard are two notification signs. The first is an envelope sign for notification on patients’ consultation requests and offer acceptances while the second is a chat sign for notification on pending chats. All notifications will drop there. If you click any, it will display the details. 

			  </div>

			   <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'relate'">
				 <h6>How can I refer patients to my colleagues ?</h6>
You can refer patients to your professional colleagues for expert management if you discover they have medical conditions you are not specialized to manage. On the patients folder, click the refer button and find the colleague by name or ID in the selected city and refer.<br><br>

<h6>How Can I find Drugs in Pharmacies ?</h6>
After writing prescriptions, forward them to specific pharmacies to search their availability. If they are available you can either place order for them or request your patient to go buy them. If they are not available, you can search for them in other pharmacies and in other cities until you find them. <br><br>

<h6>How do I Relate to Pharmacies ?</h6>
Search results for drugs have a message button beside each listed pharmacy which can be used to chat with them. Inquiries for availability and prices can be done through this service.<br><br>

<h6>How do I find diagnostic centers to send requests to?</h6>
Use the ‘Searches’ button on your dashboard to locate the search bar for laboratories and radiology centers. Type the required investigations and search. You will receive a result of all centers in the city which provide the service. You may then chat with them or forward the request to them. This request will be sent to both the diagnostic center and the patient. The patient will need to visit the center for sample collection and investigation. Some laboratories provide home service and if the patient is willing to pay for it he can access the luxury. <br><br>

<h6>How do I relate to diagnostic centers ?</h6>
You will relate with diagnostic centers essentially by chat just as the pharmaciesdo. You may also invite them to video conferences when you need to.

			  </div>

			  <div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'finance'">
			  <h6>What is MediPay ?</h6>
MediPay is the name of the electronic wallet for Applinic. All payments for health services on the platform are to be made through the wallet. Consultation fees, treatment charges and other bills are expected to be made by patients through MediPay. It is through this system that Applinic also receives its discounts. Once a provider opens an account on Applinic, an e-wallet account is assigned him by default. The account becomes immediately operational as soon as the provider is verified. <br><br>

<h6>How do I bill my patients ?</h6>
Patients are either billed from the consultation request page (Consultation fee) or from the patients’ e-folder (treatment/procedure fee). Doctors generate their bills and present to the patient for review. If they accept it, the system will debit their account and credit you. If not, the transaction will not happen. If the patient doesn’t have enough money in his account, the system will prompt him or her to fund the account.<br><br>

<h6>What if the transaction fails ?</h6>
If due to network failure or other reason, the transaction fails to complete, the process may be repeated up to three times. If the failure persists, the health provider can collect cash from the patient and call our toll free Customer Service line to report the failed transaction for manual entry into the system or fill the failed transaction form to report it. This will enable us update the transaction and enter the prescription or diagnostic results into the patient’s account. The equivalent discount will then be debited the provider and credited the patient. <br><br>

<h6>Can Users Transfer Money To One Another ?</h6>
Applinic has the leverage of enabling intra-platform money transfers strictly for the payment of health services. Users, both patients and health providers can transfer money to friends and families to enable them pay for consultations, drugs, diagnostic services and treatments at no transaction costs. Patients can not cash out their wallets. Only health providers can. Also transfers can be made only to patients. It cannot be made to health providers by any user.<br><br>

<h6>How do I access or cash out my earnings ?</h6>

The system will open the field for you to enter the amount you want to cash out and your receiving bank account details. When you do and send the request, a One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to your phone by SMS to validate the transaction.

							<h5>Where Do We Start?</h5>
				<h6>- What should we do after opening account?</h6>
				The very first thing to do after opening a pharmaceutical account is to update your profile and
				drug inventory.


				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Why should we update our profile?</h6>
				After creation of your account, you need to add your pharmacy store’s profile picture, verify
				your practice and profile your bank account for cashing out to set the stage for your practice on
				Applinic. You may also assign a trusted staff to manage your account, if you will be too busy to
				do so.


				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How should we update our inventory?</h6>
				The very first time you create a pharmacy Applinic account, your inventory will be populated
				with drugs from our database. You need to update this list as a matter of priority. Uncheck all
				the drugs you don’t have in stock and add those you have that we didn’t capture. Your
				inventory will then be up to date. This will open your world of online business through the
				Applinic platform.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Why should we update our services?</h6>
				It is highly advisable to update your drug inventory for two reasons. First, Applinic has an in-built
				drug-search which enables doctors, patients and other users search for drugs on the platform
				before going to buy them. If your inventory is not updated and searches are done for drugs you
				have, the system will not list your store in the search result, so you may miss sales. Secondly, if
				you don’t have a drug in stock and your inventory shows you do, the customer who visits your
				store to buy them will be disappointed to discover you don’t have them in stock and may be
				discouraged from patronizing you the next time your center appears in a search result.
				</div>


				<div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'info2'">
				<h5> How Do I Optimize Patronage?</h5>
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Why should we be online always?</h6>
				To optimize patronage, you need to be always logged in with any available device so you can see
				and respond to chat inquiries and other service opportunities that may present. Patients,
				doctors and other users are more likely to patronize you when you are online than when you are
				off. You may designate or delegate a trusted staff to remain online for your center and notify
				you whenever there is a request he cannot handle.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Why assist Patients fund accounts?</h6>
				Patients who don’t have money in their e-wallet accounts to pay for your services but have cash
				can be assisted. The system allows you to fund their e-wallets for them. This is done by direct
				
				transfer from your account to theirs in exchange for their cash and then transacting the
				payment through the Medipay e-wallet. When patients pay through their wallets, the platform
				records their prescriptions in their electronic medical records. But if they pay cash, this record
				cannot be kept. E-wallet payment is the way the application confirms the drugs were truly
				procured.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What if a patient has no account?</h6>
				All health providers can open temporary accounts for their patients who don’t have an account
				before they attend to them. They do this with just the patient’s name and phone number. Other
				details can be filled in by the patient at a later time. To do this, click on the create account
				button on the dashboard and fill the basic information in the fields provided.
				</div>



				<div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'info3'">
				<h5> How Do We Manage Our Account?</h5>
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How can we access our sales?</h6>
				The Work History button on the dashboard opens up all the cases that have been attended to
				for a period. In fact it provides this information based on periodic categorizations. Click on any
				button that represents a period to view the details of your activities for the selected period.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Where do we see our unattended requests?</h6>
				All pending prescriptions from doctors, patients and other customers are listed in the Work List.
				The Work List button drops down the list of pending tasks when it is clicked. Click on each
				request to view the details. You may then attend to them from there.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Where do we find prescriptions?</h6>
				The prescriptions for all patients not sent directly to you can be found in the prescription pool
				by clicking the ‘Find Patient Prescription’ button. This will open a search bar for you to type the
				reference number of the prescription. If this is typed correctly, it will search for the prescription
				and display its details. From here the request can be processed and served.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Can we refer patients to doctors</h6>
				All health providers including Pharmacists can refer patients to physicians for expert
				management. By using the Refer button, pharmacists can achieve this purpose.
				</div>



				<div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'info4'">
				<h5> How Do We Communicate?</h5>
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What are the available modes of communication?</h6>
				The basic and main channel of communication for pharmacists with other platform users is chat.
				Sometimes they may be invited to participate in a video conference.
				
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we view or commence chats?</h6>
				You can view chats by clicking on the chat notification sign on the dashboard. It will open the
				chat in details. You can also commence chats by clicking on the chat sign beside any user the
				pharmacist finds through a completed search.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What notifications should we expect?</h6>
				On top of the dashboard are two notification signs. The first is a bell sign for notifications on
				requests, prescriptions and so forth while the second is a chat sign for notification on pending
				chats. All notifications will drop there. If you click on any, the details will be displayed.
				</div>




				<div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'info5'">
				<h5> How Do We Integrate Dispatch Delivery?</h5>
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we use the dispatch service?</h6>
				To render dispatch service, the administrator for Applinic needs to activate your center for
				dispatch after you have applied to support@applinic.com. If your application is approved, the
				‘Courier Services’ button on the pharmacy dashboard will become active. Click on it to view the
				requests you have from customers who want to buy your drugs under the terms of home
				delivery. Accept the requests and bill the drugs requested. If the customer accepts it, you will
				receive the credit value of the drug requested. You may then release the drugs to the rider.
				Please review the appropriate section of the Terms of Use to understand the legal details of this
				service.
				<br/><br/><h6>- How much does the service cost?</h6>
				There are two ways drug dispatch services are billed. The first is a city-fixed charge per delivery
				irrespective of location of the buyer and the second is a manual location-based billing by the
				courier operator. Either of these may be used at any time depending on the market factors.
				When the second model is in operation and you receive a request, you can bill the customer
				based on both the value of the drug and his location.
				<br/><br/><h6>- Who directs the dispatch delivery services</h6>
				The dispatch delivery service in each city is a third party service that is operated by a franchisee.
				The management of this service is different from Applinic but we provide the guidelines and
				regulations. The rules and policies governing them are universal and apply in every city with
				minor price variations. Neither the franchisees nor their riders collect cash from customers. All
				payments for drugs and their dispatch must be made using MediPay E-wallet. You may report an
				undesirable experience with any courier service by mail to info@applinic.com or by call to our
				customer care line - +2349080045678.
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we get our monies for drugs for dispatch?</h6>
				All payments for drugs including dispatch are made through MediPay e-wallet. When drugs are
				paid for by MediPay, the pharmacy receives the deposit instantly and it can be cashed out at
				will.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What rules and governs them?</h6>
				The details of the policies governing the dispatch delivery services can be found in the relevant
				section of the pharmacies’ Terms of Use and the information palettes on the pharmacy
				dashboard.
				</div>




				<div class="card p-4" ng-if="picked === 'info6'">
				<h5>How Do We Manage Our Finances?</h5>

				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What is MediPay?
				MediPay is the name of the electronic wallet for Applinic. All payments for health services
				including drugs and pharmaceutical products on the platform are to be made by the patients
				through the wallet. It is through this system that Applinic also receives its discounts. Once a
				provider opens an account on Applinic, an e-wallet account is assigned to him by default. The
				account becomes immediately operational as soon as the provider is verified.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we bill prescriptions?
				Electronic prescriptions are served by costing of the drugs on the platform and submission to
				patients for approval. If the patient accepts the bill, the system will send an OTP to the patient’s
				phone number to confirm he initiated the debit. He will give this number to the pharmacy to
				enter and validate the transaction after which the buyer’s account will be debited to credit the
				pharmacy.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How should the patient pay for my products?</h6>
				Patients and customers will pay for all your pharmaceutical products using the MediPay. All
				credits to your account are instant. You may also cash out the money into your regular bank
				account.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- Why must I receive payments through the E-wallet?</h6>
				E-wallet payment via MediPay is the standard payment model for all sales and services on
				Applinic. This makes record keeping easier, especially the recording of patient’s medical history.
				That is one of the main objectives of Applinic.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- What if the transaction fails?</h6>
				If due to network failure or other reason, the transaction fails to complete, the health provider
				can collect cash from the patient and call our Customer Service line on +2349080045678 or send
				mail to info@applinic.com to report the failed transaction for manual entry into the system.
				Alternatively, he may fill the failed transaction form to report it. This will enable us update the
				transaction and enter the prescription or diagnostic results into the patient’s account. The
				equivalent discount will then be debited the provider and credited the patient.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we access or cash out our earnings?</h6>
				Providers can cash out their earnings by clicking on the ‘Cash Out’ button on the Payment &amp;
				Wallet menu. This menu is on the left side of the dashboard. The system will open the field for
				
				you to enter the amount you want to cash out. When you do and send the request, a One Time
				Password (OTP) will be sent to your phone by SMS to validate the transaction. Type this OTP in
				the space provided and your wallet will be debited to credit your profiled bank account.
				
				<br/><br/><h6>- How secure is the Medipay wallet?</h6>
				
				 MediPay applies the contemporary cutting edge technology in today’s web security and online
				financial safe practice through the use of end-to-end encryption, secure gateways and anti-
				hack/malware applications to secure our in-app transactions. These systems are regularly
				updated. Our third party payment gate-way - Paystack which transfers value from your wallet to
				bank account provides secure interbank services globally and observes best practices in online
				financial security.
			<br/><br/><h6>	- Can Users Transfer Money To One Another?</h6>
				Applinic has the leverage of enabling intra-platform money transfers strictly for the payment of
				health services. Users can transfer money to friends and families to enable them pay for
				consultations, drugs, diagnostic services and treatments at no transaction costs.
				<br/><br/><h6>- How do we view our transaction history</h6>
				The record of financial transactions on Applinic including account payment for services received
				and transfers is kept in your MediPay wallet. This can be accessed on the dashboard by clicking
				the e-wallet button on the left hand menu of the dashboard. This history can be searched by
				period and printed or mailed.
				<br/><br/><h6>- How much do we pay Applinic for using the platform?</h6>
				Applinic registration, online services, medical records archival and access are all free to the
				patient and providers. Providers don’t pay to open an account or to use the service.
				Nevertheless depending on the city, we receive a discount of 5-10% of the patient’s bill for every
				payment made. Please review the terms of use and the explanatory notes in the dashboard
				palettes to update yourself on the discount requirements.

	diagnostic centers. Patients whose studies were performed by non-partners can also upload
	
	their studies if they pay to obtain the Medical record Access (MRA) key which enables health
	providers to access and view the studies with DICOM viewer. The patient has to open Applinic
	account like all others, fund the account and make payment from his e-wallet to obtain the key.
